# Writing & AI Portfolio – Jennifer Oriwoh

Hi, I’m Jennifer Oriwoh. I work across academic research, technical writing, market research, and I’m currently transitioning into AI engineering.

This repository collects samples of my work, including:

- Academic research and reflective papers  
- Technical and AI-related writing  
- Market and business research pieces  
- Professional emails and communication samples  

As I grow in AI engineering, I will add small projects, notes, and experiments here.

## Structure

- `academic-research/` – selected academic and research papers  
- `technical-writing/` – technical and AI-focused pieces  
- `market-research/` – market and business analysis samples   
- `professional-emails/` – examples of professional communication (anonymized)
